# Web Development Final Project - *Productivity Club*

Submitted by: **Harshavardan Yuvaraj**

This web app: **This web app is a productivity forum for people to share tips and tricks to gain command over their time and energy. Users can  create new posts, comment on existing ones, and ask questions too! Posts can be ordered from latest to most popular and filtered by flags such as hack, question, or all. Users can protect and ensure their right to edit or remove their original posts via a secret key set by them upon the posts' creation.Â **

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **A create form that allows the user to create posts**
- [X] **Posts have a title and optionally additional textual content and/or an image added as an external image URL**
- [X] **A home feed displaying previously created posts**
- [X] **By default, the time created, title, and number of upvotes for each post is shown on the feed**
- [X] **Clicking on a post shall direct the user to a new page for the selected post**
- [X] **Users can sort posts by either their created time or upvotes count**
- [X] **Users can search for posts by title**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Users can customize the interface of the web app

## Notes

Implementing the filters for this web app was a huge challenge for me. With careful and methodically developed code, all filters, in addition to the strecth feature flags, were implemented. The secret key implementation was also tricky, but more sincere references to documentation allowed for the development of this strong feature.
